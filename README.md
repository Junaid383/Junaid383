   I'm passionate about learning the latest and greatest technologies whether that's the frontend or backend. I spend most of my time learning and experimenting with anything that looks promising. I always want to learn new things and expand my domain of expertise and knowledge. I am an engineer who loves to solve problems and use the best tool for the problem.
